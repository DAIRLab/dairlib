# dairlib
Warning! This is very much "development-level" code and is provided as-is. APIs are likely to be unstable and, while we hope for the documentation to be thorough and accurate, we make no guarantees.

## Current Continuous Integration Status
* `master` (Ubuntu Bionic) build and unit tests: [![Build Status](https://api.cirrus-ci.com/github/DAIRLab/dairlib.svg?task=build&script=test)](https://cirrus-ci.com/github/DAIRLab/dairlib)
* `master` (macOS) build and unit tests: [![Build Status](https://api.cirrus-ci.com/github/DAIRLab/dairlib.svg?task=osx_build_task&script=test)](https://cirrus-ci.com/github/DAIRLab/dairlib)
## Complete Build Instructions
* Experimental build against Drake's `master` branch: [![Build Status](https://api.cirrus-ci.com/github/DAIRLab/dairlib.svg?task=drake_master_build&script=test)](https://cirrus-ci.com/github/DAIRLab/dairlib)
## Complete Build Instructions

### Download dairlib
1. Clone `dairlib` into the your workspace, e.g. "my-workspace/dairlib".
```
git clone https://github.com/DAIRLab/dairlib.git
```

### Build Drake
The library is meant to be built with Drake (see http://drake.mit.edu/ for more details). There are two ways to use Drake within dairlib:
#### Option 1: use pegged revision
The only specific action needed here is to install all of Drake's prerequisites. There are two choices
1. (Experimental) In `dairlib/install`, run the appropriate `install_prereqs_xxx.sh`. This is untested on mac, and has not been tested to get every dependency for a fresh install.
2. Download a source copy of drake, and install pre-requisites as described here: http://drake.mit.edu/from_source.html

bazel will automatically download the pegged revision, specified in the WORKSPACE file. dairlib developers hope to keep this pegged revision current, and ensure that the pegged version will always work with a specific version of dairlib.

This option is recommended for users who are not currently editing any source code in Drake itself. 
#### Option 2: source install of Drake
Install Drake from source into `"my-workspace"/drake` http://drake.mit.edu/from_source.html. You do not need to build it, but prerequisites should also be installed. You will need `git` to start.

To tell dairlib to use your local install, set the environment variable `DAIRLIB_LOCAL_DRAKE_PATH`, e.g.
```
export DAIRLIB_LOCAL_DRAKE_PATH=/home/user/my-workspace/drake
```

### Other dependencies
These dependencies are necessary for some advanced visualization and process management. Many examples will work without a full installation of Director or libbot, but (for lab members), these are ultimately recommended. 
1. Install a local copy of `lcm` and `libbot2` using `sudo apt install lcm libbot2'. The prerequisites installation from Drake should add the proper repo for these. (This likely require's Drake's prerequisites to be installed from a source copy).

### Notes for macOS

1. Be sure to have Xcode 9.0 or later installed with Command Line Tools. If you receive a `clang: error: cannot specify -o when generating multiple output files` message during the build process, re-run `install_prereqs.sh`, and be sure that it runs fully before termination, as this will reconfigure Xcode to work with Drake.

### Build dairlib
Build what you want via Bazel. From `dairlib`, `bazel build ...` will build the entire project. Drake will be built as an external dependency.

## Included Modules
A list of included modules

### DIRCON
A modern Drake implementation of the DIRCON constrained trajectory optimization algorithm. Currently under construction. See `/examples/PlanarWalker/run_gait_dircon.cc` for a simple example of the hybrid DIRCON algorithm. The more complete example set (from the paper) currently exists on an older version of Drake https://github.com/mposa/drake/tree/hybrid-merge

## Docker (experimental)
Docker support is currently experimental. See `install/bionic/Dockerfile` for an Ubuntu Dockerfile. Docker is being used in conjuction with Cirrus Continuous Integration, and should be better supported in the future.
