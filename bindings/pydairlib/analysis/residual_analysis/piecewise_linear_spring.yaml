# Piecewise stiffness and offset for springs.
# The parameters are obtained by doing least square of the log of 03_15_22 log 11, 
# which can be accessed by https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1FCpdY-4dInvxIUGbf8bPNvdhKK5JlbN6.
# The values are consistent with other logs for both walking and running
