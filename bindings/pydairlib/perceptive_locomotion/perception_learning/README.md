## Sandbox for learning perceptive locomotion for Cassie

This is an environment to support some initial work doing perceptive learning on 
Cassie. A lot of the infrastructure builds off of what we built for Humanoids 2023, 
"Bipedal Walking on Constrained Footholds with MPC Footstep Control"  
For questions about infrastructure and setup, reach out to
[@Brian-Acosta](github.com/Brian-Acosta). 

### Ground rules:
1. To keep this workspace tidy, any temporary files like logs, data, etc. should be
saved to the tmp subdirectory, which is already part of the global 
dairlib .gitignore on this branch.
