##Sandbox for learning perceptive locomotion for Cassie

This is an environment to support som initial work doing perceptive learning on 
Cassie. For questions about infrastructure and setup, reach out to 
@Brian-Acosta. 

###Ground rules:
1. To keep this workspace tidy, any temporary files like logs, data, etc. should be
saved to the tmp subdirectory, which is already part of the global 
dairlib .gitignore on this branch.
