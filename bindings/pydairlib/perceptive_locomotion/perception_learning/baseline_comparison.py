# This script is meant to run pure lqr and nnlqr on the same height map and same initial condition, and compare the results.

# Run the alip_nn_lqr_test script and grab state at every time step to compute accumulated cost.
# Run the alip_lqr_test script and grab state at every time step to compute accumulated cost.
# Plot the accumulated cost for both cases.
