import lcm

# File has three main components:
# First, the LCM interface
# Second, the actual optimizer
# There is an ambiguity. Should we be learning how to actually optimize?
# Or just have some fixed optimization routine? where does learning get
# injected into this procedure?
# Meta-learning? Learn a swing foot that is good after only 1 gradient step?
# Learn a value function in simulation, try to apply to real? What would the
# mismatches look like?


# Learn what is unsafe in sim, then learn what is optimal in real?
