Examples for Impact Invariant Control

This folder contains the primary source code for the joint space walking controller for Rabbit and the operational space
jumping controller for Cassie as well as other scripts and dependencies.

We use `bazel` to build our code. To build all of the example scripts, use the command 
`bazel build examples/impact_invariant_control/...`.

We use procman to organize all the scripts, to use procman, use the command 
`bot-procman-sheriff -l examples/impact_invariant_control/impact_invariant_examples.pmd`.
