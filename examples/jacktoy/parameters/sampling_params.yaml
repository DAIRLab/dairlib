# Sampling strategy.  These should match the names in sampling_params.h.
# 0 means radially symmetric sampling on a circle.
# 1 means random sampling on a 2D circle.
# 2 means random sampling on a 3D sphere.
# 3 means a fixed sample location. Currently allows for 3 fixed sample.

# num_additional_samples_c3 is in addition to that one.

# Parameters for the cost function.
# 0 means simulate dynamics for both ee and object positions to compute cost.
# 1 means use z_fin from C3 solution for both ee and object positions to compute cost.

# 3 means use U from C3 solution and add cost associated with tracking the ee
# trajectory in c3 and simulate the object trajectory.
