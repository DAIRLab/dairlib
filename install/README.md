## Additional Installation Configurations

dairlib can be built with many different external packages and solvers. Installation instructions are detailed here (some may be out of date)

### ROS
To integrate with ROS (tested on ROS Noetic with 20.04), the following steps are required.
1. Install ROS http://wiki.ros.org/ROS/Installation
2. Do not forget to setup your environment. For instance, add these lines to `~/.bashrc`
```
export ROS_MASTER_URI=http://localhost:11311
source /opt/ros/noetic/setup.bash 
```
3. Install additional dependencies
```
sudo apt install python3-rosinstall-generator python-catkin-tools python3-vcstool
```
4. Build the ROS workspace using catkin. From `dairlib/`,
```
sudo ./tools/workspace/ros/compile_ros_workspace.sh
```
5. Set the environment variable `DAIRLIB_WITH_ROS` to `ON`. For instance, add to `~/.bashrc`
```
export DAIRLIB_WITH_ROS=ON
```

### SNOPT
Download and setup SNOPT

dairlib, by default, assumes that users have access to SNOPT(https://web.stanford.edu/group/SOL/snopt.htm), though it is not required. **If you do not have SNOPT**, you will need to edit `.bazelrc` and change `build --define=WITH_SNOPT=ON` to `build --define=WITH_SNOPT=OFF`

For users at Penn, download SNOPT (https://www.seas.upenn.edu/~posa/snopt/snopt7.6.tar.gz) and add the following line to your `~/.bashrc`
```
export SNOPT_PATH=<the directory you downloaded to>/snopt7.6.tar.gz
```

There is no need to extract the tar.

### GUROBI
Download and setup GUROBI, currently tested with `gurobi1003`

```
export GUROBI_HOME=<gurobi_directory>
```

add the line `build --define=WITH_GUROBI=ON` to the `.bazelrc`

### Local Version of Drake
The library is meant to be built with Drake (see http://drake.mit.edu/ for more details). Often, we will use an older version of drake with the commit defined in the [WORKSPACE](WORKSPACE) file or using the environment variable `DAIRLIB_LOCAL_DRAKE_PATH` set to the root of the drake repository.

For example:
```
export DAIRLIB_LOCAL_DRAKE_PATH=/home/user/my-workspace/drake
```

### Invariant-EKF
State Estimation for Cassie is done using contact-aided invariant-EKF. `invariant-ekf` is an external repository forked from Ross Hartley's repository of the same name. By default, a pegged version of this forked repository is used i.e. the `bazel` branch of DAIR lab's fork of `invariant-ekf` is automatically downloaded and used. However, to make changes to the files, the [DAIR Lab's fork of invariant-ekf](https://github.com/DAIRLab/invariant-ekf/tree/bazel "DAIR Lab's fork of invariant-ekf") can be cloned as a local repository.

To use local version of `invariant-ekf`, set the environment variable `DAIRLIB_LOCAL_INEKF_PATH`, e.g.
```
export DAIRLIB_LOCAL_INEKF_PATH=/home/user/my-workspace/invariant-ekf
```




#### Docker (experimental, may be broken)
Docker support is currently experimental. See `install/bionic/Dockerfile` for an Ubuntu Dockerfile. Docker is being used in conjuction with Cirrus Continuous Integration, and should be better supported in the future.
